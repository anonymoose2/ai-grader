        <p><strong><em>This is my first time using this site. Where do I start?</em></strong></p>
        <p>For the new users, we've created a sample lab which has an extremely simple grader you can start testing on. Click on the [+] that appears 
        when you select <code>Sample Lab</code> from the dropdown to toggle the description. It gives a quick overview of what the grader does. You can enter 
        your input into the text area on the right-hand side of the page and click the submit button to start the grader.</p>
        <p>If you're interested in how the site works, take a look at the <a href="{% url 'index' %}">about</a> page.</p>
        <p><strong><em>How do I select a lab?</em></strong></p>
        <p>To select a lab, click on the dropdown and begin entering a lab name. If you don't enter any text, the dropdown will 
        display all available labs.</p>
        <p><strong><em>How do I enter my code?</em></strong></p>
        <p>If your code is on your computer, you have two options. You can either paste your code into the text area on the right, or you can 
        click the choose file button and enter your code there. If you choose to use the web editor, the code will persist until you refresh the page.</p>
        <p><strong><em>The website isn't showing the grader's output. What do I do?</em></strong></p>
        <p>This generally happens when there are a lot of people submitting their code at the same time. As the labs get more difficult, the amount of time 
        required for the grader usually increases because students submit slower code. Please don't keep on clicking the submit button. If after 10-15 minutes, 
        there's still no output, you can try submitting your code again.</p>
